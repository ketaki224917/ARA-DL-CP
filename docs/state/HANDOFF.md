# HANDOFF (overwritten after every task)

Updated: 2026-10-23 | Session #: 1  
Current phase/task: Phase 3 / P3.1 - typed AgentState | Status: ready; all three MCP servers, stdio client, Desktop sample, and protocol verification are committed

Last completed task commit: `855317b` - [P2.6] Document Claude Desktop stdio setup.

## Do next (exact)
1. Read the remaining Phase 3 state requirements in `AGENTS.md` and inspect the existing RAG evidence types before defining agent state.
2. Implement `src/ara/agents/state.py` with Pydantic models for topic, plan, evidence store, draft, critiques, revision count, and run metadata; validate the fields needed by later planner/researcher/writer tasks.
3. Add state serialization and validation tests, run the full checks, record a state design decision, then continue to P3.2.

## Environment state
Windows 11; PowerShell; Git 2.55.0. Python 3.12.15 and uv 0.13.4 are installed under ignored `.tools/`; `.venv` and `uv.lock` are present. The lock resolves 156 packages, including DDGS 9.16.0; the dev environment includes pytest 8.4.2, Ruff 0.17.2, mypy 1.20.2, MCP SDK 2.3.0, and ChromaDB 1.5.9. Set `UV_SYSTEM_CERTS=true` for PyPI TLS and `UV_CACHE_DIR=.tools/uv-cache` to avoid the default AppData cache lock error. Public PyPI access works; the user confirmed there is no trusted internal mirror. GNU Make and Ollama are unavailable. Hardware probing found 18 logical processors and 15.52 GiB RAM, but no supported CUDA/MPS adapter; exact display hardware/VRAM is unknown. No models are pulled and no services are running.

## WIP / uncommitted
The P2.6 code/docs commit is `855317b`; the state-file follow-up commit is pending. P2.5 code/state commits are `5622d2a` and `6bcbad3`; P2.4 code/state commits are `c822b17` and `5567002`; P2.3 code/state commits are `f260566` and `73ed8d9`. Earlier work includes P0.1 and P0.5-P0.7 through `e705513`, `0e97fd5`, `411fa3f`, and `b2db93c`; P1.1 `50af3fc`; P1.3 `54f0772`; P1.11 `cdcba25` with state follow-up `17b1052`; P2.1 `0bdbaf1` with state follow-up `9bd2e28`; and P2.2 `4526588` with handoff follow-up `a22878b`.

## Known failing tests / issues
No known pytest/Ruff/mypy failures: `.tools/uv/uv.exe run --locked --no-sync pytest` -> 121 passed; Ruff is clean; mypy reports no issues in 26 source files. All three ARA servers were started and queried through stdio subprocesses. Claude Desktop itself was not launched, and the DDGS live search request was not smoke-tested. The four retrieval comparisons and live Ollama/Chroma CLI run remain unavailable because Ollama and model weights are absent. Exact GPU/VRAM remains unknown.

## Gotchas learned
- Use `$env:UV_SYSTEM_CERTS='true'` and `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.tools/uv-cache'` before uv commands in this environment.
- GNU Make is absent; invoke the matching uv commands directly.
- Preserve UTF-8 punctuation when editing project state files.
- The SDK's v2 API uses `MCPServer`, `Client(StdioServerParameters(...))`, and `Client(server)` for in-memory protocol tests.
- Web search snippets and fetched page text are untrusted external content; the researcher must keep them in a data-only prompt section.
- The custom scoring server returns `status="not_ready"` until P5.6 loads a trained model; it must not return made-up scores.
- The Claude Desktop JSON sample contains placeholders for the uv executable and ARA project path; replace both before using it.
