# Progress Log

### 2026-10-22 — SESSION-1 — Bootstrap inspection
Done: Confirmed the workspace was empty and had no `.git`, project files, or state directory. Checked the required tools and hardware access.
Evidence: `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -20` → both report “not a git repository”; `make test` → failed because `make` is not installed; `py --version` → no installed Python; `uv --version` and `ollama --version` → commands unavailable; `Get-CimInstance` CPU/RAM/GPU queries → WMI access denied; CPU identifier and 18 logical processors were readable.
Files: none at this inspection point.
Notes: Python/uv are needed before locking dependencies or running tests. RAM and GPU state remain unknown.

### 2026-10-22 — P0.2 — Bootstrap repository instructions and state
Done: Copied the supplied UTF-8 ARA specification to `AGENTS.md`; created all required state files, the initial full TODO, and the project directory layout. Added `CONVENTIONS.md` and initialized the workspace Git repository.
Evidence: `Get-ChildItem -Force` initially showed an empty workspace; created `docs/state/{HANDOFF,TODO,PROGRESS,DECISIONS,BLOCKERS,SESSIONS,ENVIRONMENT,CONVENTIONS}.md`, then confirmed Git recognizes the initialized `master` branch with `git -c safe.directory=... status --short --branch`. Commit NOT RUN: sandbox blocks writes to `.git` and requires approved escalation.
Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/state/*`, `.git/`.
Notes: `[P0.2]` and `[P0.3]` are complete. P0.1 packaging/lock generation remains in progress because Python and `uv` are absent.

### 2026-10-22 — P0.3 — Document coding conventions
Done: Added conventions for code style, modularity, logging, configuration, lazy model/network setup, test naming, determinism, and task commit messages.
Evidence: `Get-Content docs/state/CONVENTIONS.md` → convention file created and reviewed. Automated style checks NOT RUN because PyPI timed out before dev dependencies could be installed.
Files: `docs/state/CONVENTIONS.md`.
Notes: The conventions follow the user-supplied project requirements; the checks will run once dependencies resolve.

### 2026-10-22 — SESSION-1 — Toolchain setup and foundation implementation
Done: Installed uv 0.13.4 and managed CPython 3.12.15 in ignored `.tools/`; added packaging/config files, settings loading, logging setup, hardware probing, Ollama chat/stream/tool-call/structured-output client, and unit tests. Copied `AGENTS.md` matches the user attachment by SHA-256.
Evidence: Official uv installer completed; `.tools/uv/uv.exe python list --only-installed` → managed CPython 3.12.15 found; `.tools/python/.../python.exe -m compileall -q src tests` → passed; `uv lock` → NOT RUN TO COMPLETION because `https://pypi.org/simple/` timed out (PowerShell HEAD probe timed out after 15 seconds). pytest/ruff/mypy → NOT RUN because dependencies could not be resolved/installed.
Files: `pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`, `config.yaml`, `.env.example`, `Makefile`, `src/ara/config.py`, `src/ara/logging_setup.py`, `src/ara/hardware.py`, `src/ara/llm/client.py`, and tests.
Notes: P0.1 remains blocked on package-index access. P0.4-P0.7 code exists but remains in progress until dependency-backed tests pass. `.git` cannot be written from the current sandbox; no task commits exist yet.

### 2026-10-22 — SESSION-1 — Commit bootstrap tasks
Done: Committed P0.2 and P0.3 separately after approved Git escalation. Commit identity was passed for those commands only; global Git settings were not changed.
Evidence: `git log --oneline -3` → `f178f8c [P0.3] Document project conventions`; `21354d1 [P0.2] Bootstrap persistent instructions and state`.
Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/state/*`.
Notes: The preceding entry recorded the state before these commits. ENV-003 is resolved; later code tasks still need their own commits.

### 2026-10-22 — P0.8 — Build the open-licensed sample corpus
Done: Added 19 original explanatory Markdown notes on local retrieval and evidence grounding, with a CC BY 4.0 notice and a source/license manifest covering the upstream references. Logged ADR-003 for the corpus approach.
Evidence: PowerShell corpus check → 19 numbered notes, 0 missing reference lines, `LICENSE.md` and `SOURCES.md` present; Python `compileall -q src tests` → passed. Upstream claims and license metadata were checked against official documentation/repository pages; no upstream text was reproduced verbatim.
Files: `data/sample_corpus/*.md`, `docs/state/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/state/TODO.md`.
Notes: These are original concise summaries, not bundled copies of the complete source pages. The task is ready to commit; dependency-backed tests remain blocked on PyPI connectivity.
